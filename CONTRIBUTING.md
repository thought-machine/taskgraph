# Contributing

This module is primarily maintained for Thought Machine's use case, but external contributions are
welcome.

## Potential improvements

* Limiting parallelism
* Deadlock detection
* Observability and debugging

## Making changes

Please run `go build ./...`, `go test`, and `golangci-lint run` before submitting a PR. Github
Actions will also run these commands, but running them yourself means faster feedback!
